All files from C:\users\*user*\AndroidStudioProjects\geocacheApp\app\src are included in this .zip.

I don't think anything else is required to recreate the project, as this contains all Kotlin code, all XML, all config and all image assets.

The app was tested on an emulator using a Pixel 3 running API 28, but was also tested on a physical LG G6 also running API 28.

I have not included a compiled .apk in with this as requested.

All API keys are included in with this that allow the app to function. 
The Firebase instance the app communicates with has been left totally open to read from/write to.
